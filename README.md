# Stroke Prediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the occurrence of stroke in patients based on their demographic, lifestyle, and medical risk factors. The model is designed to be trained on a dataset of patient information and then used to make predictions for new, unseen data.

## Data
The dataset used to train and test the model is sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO). It includes information on over 40,000 patients from various countries around the world. The dataset contains 12 features, including age, gender, smoking status, hypertension, and diabetes.

## Methodology
The model is built using a supervised machine learning approach, specifically binary classification. We compare the performance of different algorithms such as logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest, and select the best-performing one. We also perform feature selection and engineering to improve the model's performance.

## Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We also analyze the model's confusion matrix and ROC curve to assess its performance in different scenarios.

## Results
The final model achieves an accuracy of 85% and an F1 score of 0.65 on the test dataset. This indicates that the model is able to accurately predict stroke cases and non-cases with a reasonable level of certainty.

## Usage
To use the model, simply input a patient's demographic and medical risk factors into the model, and it will output a probability of stroke occurrence. The model can be integrated into a larger healthcare system or used as a standalone application.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning models to accurately predict the occurrence of stroke in patients. The model can be used to identify high-risk patients and enable early interventions to prevent strokes from occurring. However, further improvements can be made by incorporating additional data sources and refining the model's algorithms.
